# HackProbe - A Basic Search Engine for Cheat Sheets created by you, for you

---

## What is HackProbe?

HackProbe is a Flask-based API that uses MongoDB to perform fuzzy searching on the JSON cheat sheet that you create.

> Note: I will provide you with a pretty big JSON file that you can use to test the API. You can also use it to create your own cheat sheet.

## What I want HackProbe to be

[x] - A quick search engine to search for the commands that you need to carry out a certain task
[ ] - An admin frontend to add, edit and delete cheat sheets without having to mess with RAW JSON
[ ] - A really really pretty frontend that is easy to use and navigate
[ ] - A way to share your cheat sheets with others
[ ] - A `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used to deploy the API, database and the frontend altogether
[ ] - An easy to deploy API that can be deployed on Heroku or any other cloud provider or a simple Docker container
