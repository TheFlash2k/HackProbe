# HackProbe - A Search Engine for JSON-based Cheat Sheets

---

## What is HackProbe?

HackProbe is a search engine for JSON-based cheat sheets. It is a simple FastAPI based API that can be used to search for commands that you need to carry out a certain task. It is currently in development and is not ready for production use.

> Note: I will provide you with a pretty big JSON file that you can use to test the API. You can also use it to create your own cheat sheet.

## How to use HackProbe?

Hackprobe uses Next.js as the frontend and FastAPI as the backend. To run the project, you need to have Node.js 14+ installed on your system.

```sh
cd app/
npm install
npm run dev
```

### NOTE

This is currently a work in progress. I will update this README as I make progress on the project. I'm making this project in my spare time. If you want to contribute, please feel free to do so.
